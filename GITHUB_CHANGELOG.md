Lawnchair 15 Beta 2 is a foundational release based on Launcher3 from Android 15. This version works with QuickSwitch from Android 10 to Android 15 QPR1. Higher Android versions are not yet supported.

### New Features
*   **Android 15 Support:** Includes core platform features like Private Space and App Archiving.
*   **App Drawer Folders:** A major new way to organize your app drawer.
    *   **Manual Folders:** Create, edit, and re-arrange your own custom folders.
    *   **Automatic Organization ("Caddy"):** An experimental feature to automatically categorize your entire app drawer into smart folders.
*   **Dock Enhancements:**
    *   Add a background to the dock with options for color and corner radius.
    *   Place widgets directly in the dock.
    *   Show icon labels for apps in the dock.
*   **Wallpaper Carousel:** A new pop-up menu item to quickly switch between your current and recent wallpapers, similar to the Pixel Launcher.
*   **App Pausing:** For rooted users with QuickSwitch, you can now manually pause applications directly from the launcher.
*   **Expanded Search Options:**
    *   Add custom search engines for web suggestions in the app drawer.
    *   New web search providers added, including Ecosia, Kagi, Firefox, Iceraven, and Mull.
*   **"Deck" (Experimental):** An initial implementation of a "no app drawer" mode. *Please create a launcher backup before trying this feature to prevent data loss.*

### Improvements
*   **UI:** Updated many UI components to better align with Material 3 design principles.
*   **Gestures:** Added "Open Recents Screen" and "Open Assistant" as new gesture actions.
*   **Pop-Up Menu:** The long-press menu options can now be reordered.
*   **Settings:** Reorganized many settings for a more intuitive experience and centralized all search-related settings into a single screen.

### Core & Under-the-Hood
*   **Type-Safe Navigation:** The settings infrastructure has been rewritten using modern Jetpack Compose Navigation for enhanced stability.
*   **Build & Dependency Updates:** Major updates to dependencies and build scripts improve performance and maintainability.
*   **New Translations:** Translations have been updated from Crowdin.
*   **Nightly Builds:** A formal nightly build system is now in place for easier access to development versions.
*   **Crash & Bug Fixes:** Implemented numerous fixes for various OEM skins (Lenovo, Motorola), custom ROMs, and older Android versions.

### Regressions & Known Issues
*   **Icon Badges:** Icon badges for work profile apps are temporarily non-functional due to core changes in the A15 rebase. This is a high-priority item for a future update.
*   **'Customize Icon' State:** The bottom sheet for customizing an icon may not update its state immediately. Restarting the launcher will apply the change.
*   **App Drawer folders:** As of now, you can't edit app drawer folders from the app drawer. Please visit the settings screen to change the contents of each folder.
